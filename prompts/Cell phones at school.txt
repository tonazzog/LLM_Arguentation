Your principal is reconsidering the school's cell phone policy. She is considering two possible policies: 
Policy 1: Allow students to bring phones to school and use them during lunch periods and other free times, as long as the phones are turned off during class time
Policy 2: Do not allow students to have phones at school at all.
Write a letter to your principal convincing her which policy you believe is better. Support your position with specific reasons.
