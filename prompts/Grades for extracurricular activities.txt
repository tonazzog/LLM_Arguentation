Your principal is considering changing school policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average. Many students have a grade C average. She would like to hear the students' views on this possible policy change. Write a letter to your principal arguing for or against requiring at least a grade B average to participate in sports or other activities. Be sure to support your arguments with specific reasons.
