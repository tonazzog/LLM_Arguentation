Dear Principal,

I am writing to express my fervent opposition to the proposed policy change that would require a minimum grade B average for participation in extracurricular activities such as sports and clubs. While I understand the intention behind this policy, aiming to encourage academic excellence, I believe it ultimately undermines the holistic development of students and creates an environment of unnecessary pressure and exclusion.

Firstly, imposing such a stringent academic requirement disregards the diverse strengths and learning styles that exist within our student body. Some students may excel in athletics or creative pursuits while facing challenges in traditional academic settings; this policy unfairly penalizes their efforts and passions by equating extracurricular involvement solely with academic performance. It is crucial to recognize that success manifests in various forms, and a rigid focus on grades risks neglecting the valuable skills and experiences gained through participation in activities outside the classroom.

Moreover, this policy could inadvertently exacerbate existing inequalities within our school. Students from disadvantaged backgrounds often face additional hurdles in accessing quality education and resources, which may disproportionately impact their academic performance. To deny them the opportunity to participate in extracurricular activities based solely on grades would further marginalize these students, hindering their social development and sense of belonging within the school community.

Instead of implementing a restrictive policy, I propose exploring alternative approaches that foster both academic achievement and extracurricular engagement. Encouraging open communication between teachers, coaches, and parents can help identify students who may be struggling academically and provide them with targeted support. Additionally, implementing mentorship programs that pair successful student-athletes with those facing academic challenges could create a positive learning environment and promote peer-to-peer support.

Ultimately, our goal as educators should be to nurture well-rounded individuals who are not solely defined by their grades but also by their diverse talents, passions, and contributions to the school community. By rejecting the proposed policy and embracing a more inclusive approach, we can create an environment where all students have the opportunity to thrive both academically and personally.


Sincerely,
