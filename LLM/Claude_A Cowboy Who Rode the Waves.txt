As a former Seagoing Cowboy, I, Luke Bomberger, urge you to consider participating in this extraordinary program that not only offers unparalleled adventures but also the chance to make a meaningful difference in the world. My experiences aboard cattle boats traversing vast oceans have profoundly shaped my perspective and enriched my life in ways I could never have imagined when I first embarked on this journey as a young man fresh out of high school.

The Seagoing Cowboys program presents a unique opportunity to expand your horizons beyond the confines of your hometown, exposing you to diverse cultures and historic landmarks that will leave an indelible mark on your soul. Picture yourself standing before the majestic Acropolis in Greece, its ancient columns rising against the azure sky, or gliding through the enchanting canals of Venice in a gondola, the gentle lapping of water against stone bridges echoing centuries of history. These are but a fraction of the wondrous sights that await you, as I can attest from my personal encounters with such marvels during my nine voyages.

Moreover, this program offers far more than mere sightseeing; it provides a platform for personal growth and character development through challenging yet rewarding work. The responsibility of caring for hundreds of animals during long ocean crossings will instill in you a sense of duty and perseverance that will serve you well throughout your life. You'll learn to navigate the unpredictable nature of life at sea, facing potential dangers with courage and quick thinking, as I did when I narrowly escaped sliding overboard during a stormy night watch.

Perhaps most importantly, joining the Seagoing Cowboys allows you to contribute to a noble cause â€“ the rehabilitation of war-torn nations struggling to rebuild their agricultural foundations. By delivering livestock to countries devastated by World War II, you'll play a vital role in restoring hope and sustenance to communities in dire need. This hands-on involvement in international aid efforts will broaden your understanding of global issues and foster a deep-seated empathy for people from all walks of life.

The bonds you'll forge with fellow cowboys and the skills you'll acquire during your voyages will stay with you long after you've returned to dry land. From improvised sports tournaments in the empty holds of ships to creative pursuits that help pass the time at sea, you'll discover new talents and interests that may shape your future endeavors. In my case, the program ignited a lifelong passion for cultural exchange, leading my family to host numerous international students and visitors over the years.

In conclusion, I implore you to seize this remarkable opportunity to become a Seagoing Cowboy. It is a decision that will not only enrich your own life but also enable you to make a tangible impact on the world. The memories you create, the friendships you cultivate, and the personal growth you experience will far outweigh any temporary discomfort or challenges you may face. As someone who has lived this extraordinary adventure, I can assure you that the rewards of participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program are immeasurable and will continue to influence your life in profound and unexpected ways for years to come.
